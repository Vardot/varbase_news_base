# Varbase News Base — automated functional tests

Behaviour-Driven functional tests for the **Varbase News Base** recipe, part of
the Varbase functional testing suite (Playwright + Cucumber-js). They drive a
running Varbase site through a real browser and assert the behaviour the recipe
actually provides — the News post content type and its fields, authoring, the
news listing with its filters and pager, and the news permissions.

The `NN-NN-` prefix keeps the flat feature files ordered.

## Prerequisites

- A running Varbase site with this recipe applied (News post content type, the
  `/news` listing, Canvas templates).
- The per-role testing users from `cucumber.js` (`Normal user`, `Content
  editor`, `Content admin`, `SEO admin`, `Site admin`, `webmaster`).
- The test content seeded — a testing-only **recipe** (not a PHP fixture), so
  the listing / filter / pager scenarios have deterministic data:

  ```bash
  drush recipe /path/to/tests/recipes/varbase_news_base_test_content
  drush cache:rebuild
  ```

  It creates 15 published posts titled `Varbase Example News NN` (8 in the
  Announcements category, 7 in Press Releases), all sharing the `Varbase Example
  Tag`. The scenarios isolate them with the "Search by" keyword, so their counts
  do not depend on any other content on the site.

## Running

```bash
npm install                 # webship-js brings Cucumber-js, Playwright, tsx
npx playwright install chromium

# Point at your running site and run the whole suite:
LAUNCH_URL=https://your-site.ddev.site npm run test:chromium

# A single feature file:
FEATURES="tests/features/03-01-news-listing.feature" \
  LAUNCH_URL=https://your-site.ddev.site npm run test:chromium
```

CI installs a Varbase site that applies this recipe, seeds the users + the test
content recipe, and runs the whole suite — see `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

## Note on the `/news` listing page

The News Base recipe ships the news listing as Views **block** displays (All /
Latest / Related news posts), which a site template places on a `/news` page
(the way Varbase Blog Base's listing is placed by Varbase Starter). The CI
pipeline provisions that `/news` page for the listing / filter / pager scenarios
— see the `📋 Provision the /news listing page` note in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
